## Introduction

The COVID 19 pandemic has had a profound impact on global health and economies. This project aims to analyze the demographic distribution of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries across different countries and regions. By visualizing the data, we can gain insights into the spread and impact of the virus.

## Libraries and Data Import

The project utilizes several Python libraries for data processing and visualization:

```python
import pandas as pd  # Data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g., pd.read_csv)
import numpy as np  # Linear algebra
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  # Data visualization
import seaborn as sns  # Data visualization
import plotly.graph_objects as go  # Interactive geographical visualization
```

The dataset used in this analysis is `COVID-19_geo_timeseries_ver_0311.csv`, which contains information on COVID-19 cases, including geographical coordinates, confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries.

```python
# Import the dataset
covid_lat_long = pd.read_csv('COVID-19_geo_timeseries_ver_0311.csv')
```

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The initial exploration of the dataset involves understanding its structure, checking for missing values, and summarizing the data.

```python
# Exploring the first five rows of the dataset
covid_lat_long.head()

# Exploring the last five rows of the dataset
covid_lat_long.tail()

# Checking the info of the data
covid_lat_long.info()

# Summary statistics of the dataset
covid_lat_long.describe(include='all').transpose()

# Counting the number of unique values in each column
covid_lat_long.nunique()
```

## Handling Missing Values

Missing values in the dataset are handled by filling them with zero, ensuring that the analysis is not skewed by incomplete data.

```python
# Filling all missing values with zero(0)
covid_lat_long_filled = covid_lat_long.fillna(0)

# Verifying that there are no missing values left
covid_lat_long_filled.isnull().sum()
```

## Data Visualization

### Countplot Visualization

A countplot is used to visualize the distribution of COVID-19 cases across different regions.

```python
def countplot(x):
    plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (17, 10)
    sns.countplot(data=covid_lat_long, x=x)
    plt.xticks(rotation=90)
    return

# Plotting the countplot for regions
countplot(covid_lat_long['region'])
```

### Geographical Visualization

Geographical scatter plots and choropleth maps are used to visualize the spread of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries across the globe.

```python
def covid(hue=None):
    plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (17, 10)
    sns.scatterplot(data=covid_lat_long, x='longitude', y='latitude', hue=hue, size=hue, sizes=(10, 100))
    return

# Scatter plot of all the locations (lat-long)
covid()

# Grouping the data by country and summing the cases, deaths, and recoveries
covid_lat_long_geo = covid_lat_long.groupby(['country', 'country_code']).sum()
covid_lat_long_geo_reset = covid_lat_long_geo.reset_index()

# Visualizing the geographical distribution of confirmed cases
fig = go.Figure(data=go.Choropleth(
    locations=covid_lat_long_geo_reset['country_code'],
    z=covid_lat_long_geo_reset['confirmed_cases'],
    text=covid_lat_long_geo_reset['country'],
    colorscale='Blues',
    autocolorscale=True,
    reversescale=False,
    marker_line_color='darkgray',
    marker_line_width=0.5,
    colorbar_tickprefix='',
    colorbar_title='Covid_19<br>confirmed_cases count',
))

fig.update_layout(
    title_text='Covid_19 Lat_Long_demograph',
    geo=dict(
        showframe=False,
        showcoastlines=False,
        projection_type='equirectangular'
    )
)
fig.show()
```
